## TL;DR

> It's basically `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` written in Go, because who

### Features

* HTTPS (TLS)
* CORS support
* Request logging
* `net/http` compatible

## Installation

`serve` can be installed in a handful of ways:

### Homebrew on macOS

If you are using [Homebrew][] on macOS, you can install `serve` with the
following command:

```sh
brew install syntaqx/tap/serve
```

### Docker

The official [syntaqx/serve][docker-hub] image is available on Docker Hub.

To get started, try hosting a directory from your docker host:

```sh
docker run -v .:/var/www:ro -d syntaqx/serve
```

Alternatively, a simple `Dockerfile` can be used to generate a new image that
includes the necessary content:

```dockerfile
FROM syntaqx/serve
COPY . /var/www
```

Place this in the same directory as your content, then `build` and `run` the
container:

```sh
docker build -t some-content-serve .
docker run --name some-serve -d some-content-serve
```

#### Exposing an external port

```sh
docker run --name some-serve -d -p 8080:8080 some-content-serve
```

Then you can navigate to http://localhost:8080/ or http://host-ip:8080/ in your
browser.

#### Using environment variables for configuration

[12-factor-config]: https://12factor.net/config

Currently, `serve` only supports using the `PORT` environment variable for
setting the listening port. All other configurations are available as CLI flags.

> In future releases, most configurations will be settable from both the CLI
> flag as well as a compatible environment variable, aligning with the
> expectations of a [12factor app][12-factor-config]. But, that will require a
> fair amount of work before the functionality is made available.

Here's an example using `docker-compose.yml` to configure `serve` to use HTTPS:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: syntaqx/serve
    volumes:
      - ./static:/var/www
      - ./fixtures:/etc/ssl
    environment:
      - PORT=1234
    ports:
      - 1234
    command: serve -ssl -cert=/etc/ssl/cert.pem -key=/etc/ssl/key.pem -dir=/var/www
```

The project repository provides an example [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yml)
that implements a variety of common use-cases for `serve`. Feel free to use
those to help you get started.

### Download the binary

Quickly download install the latest release:

```sh
curl -sfL https://install.goreleaser.com/github.com/syntaqx/serve.sh | sh
```

Or manually download the [latest release][releases] binary for your system and
architecture and install it into your `$PATH`.

### From source

To build from source, check out the instructions on getting started with
[development](#development).

## Usage

```sh
serve [options] [path]
```

> `[path]` defaults to `.` (relative path to the current directory)

Then simply open your browser to http://localhost:8080 to view your server.

### Options

The following configuration options are available:

* `--host` host address to bind to (defaults to `0.0.0.0`)
* `--port` listening port (defaults to `8080`)
* `--ssl` enable https (defaults to `false`)
* `--cert` path to the ssl cert file (defaults to `cert.pem`)
* `--key` path to the ssl key file (defaults to `key.pem`)
* `--dir` directory path to serve (defaults to `.`, also configurable by `arg[0]`)
* `--users` path to users file (defaults to `users.dat`); file should contain lines of username:password in plain text

## Development

To develop `serve` or interact with its source code in any meaningful way, be
sure you have the following installed:

### Prerequisites

* [Git][git]
* [Go 1.11][golang]+ (with [`GO111MODULE`][modules] enabled)

### Tooling

* [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

> __Note__: While the tooling isn't explicitly required in order to build and
> run the project, it's for everyone's benefit that you leverage it.

### Install

You can download and install the project from GitHub by simply running:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:syntaqx/serve.git && cd $(basename $_ .git)
make install
```

This will install `serve` into your `$GOPATH/bin` directory, which assuming is
properly appended to your `$PATH`, can now be used:

```sh
$ serve version
serve version v0.0.6-8-g5074d63 windows/amd64
```

## Using `serve` manually

Besides running `serve` using the provided binary, you can also embed a
`serve.FileServer` into your own Go program:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/syntaqx/serve"
)

func main() {
    fs := serve.NewFileServer()
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", fs))
}
```
